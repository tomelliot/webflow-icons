## How to file a bug report

When filing a GitHub issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What browser are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a new feature

If you'd like to suggest a new feature, feel free to open a GitHub issue for it, and we can discuss it there. Afterwards, we can open a new issue for the implementation.
